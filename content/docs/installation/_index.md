## Linux and macOS

## Confirm Installation

Run the following command to make sure that the binary has been installed and is available system-wide:

```shell
lemmego --version
```

It should output something like this:

`version 0.1.9`

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the `lemmego` binary. In the next section, we will use this to create a new project.
